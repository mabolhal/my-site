I can close my eyes and see myself in Be’sat  
In all its glory  
The sky so blue, and colors so intense  
The smells so intense  
I am brought to my knees  
I do not belong here, yet I belong here  
My eyes take in everything  
The essence of company  
Oh how I wish to be amongst them  
After all I thrill at hitting that joke  
Your wide-eyed reaction  
I want us to laugh  
Here, right here

It is a personal thrill for me to be in my hometown. Well, what is a hometown anyway. There’s a certain openness that presents itself to you. We are all welcome here.  

There’s no other joy comparable than walking in the Sun. I could cry for you, Khorshid Khanoom.
Of course, the colors manifest themselves with absolute authority.  

Trees, so high and tall. Anxiety everywhere and I look to You for solace. You’ve been here since before me; You have everything to offer.  

Leaving you is hard every time. I’m sad to say goodbye. Sadly I cannot, as of this time, stay with you longer. I will return, I promise.
